# GMV Max Auto — what it does (plain words)

> Internal team tool for our 1 Malaysia TikTok Shop. Runs on your own laptop.
> Right now: **watch-only**. It does NOT change your ads by itself.

## What you get today (P0, live numbers)
- **One screen** (`http://127.0.0.1:8082/`) with two tables:
  - **Live per-campaign** (amber UNLAGGED badge): all 5 GMV Max campaigns —
    1 LIVE + 4 Product — with 7-day and today spend, net sales, net ROI,
    orders, budget. Refreshed by hand (`live_view.py`). Newest possible data
    (TikTok itself still lags minutes to ~2 hours — freshest, not real-time).
  - **30-min history**: closed-window snapshots every 30 minutes (2 hours
    behind on purpose — finished numbers only), with freshness stamp.
- **Net ROI everywhere** — sales minus ~25% fees (affiliates, coupons,
  platform) before ROI is computed. What you see is what you keep.
- **Branch badge** — PROD means real TikTok data. Works offline too (shows
  the last saved copy).
- **Safety rules visible** — ROI ≥ 7.0, CPA ≤ RM21.18, max scale 20–25%/day,
  no changes 4:00–5:30pm, quiet hours 2:00–6:00am. They govern every future
  auto-suggestion; today they're shown so everyone learns them.
- **Future buttons, greyed out** — rules editor and Approve/Edit/Reject queue
  are visible but disabled. They turn on in later phases.

## How to use it
1. Start the dashboard: `python gmvmax-auto/dashboard/dashboard.py`, open
   `http://127.0.0.1:8082/` in your browser.
2. Read the Live table (LIVE campaign first, then Product). Numbers are net.
3. For fresh numbers, run `python gmvmax-auto/live_view.py`, then Refresh.
4. The 30-min table fills itself (laptop must be on). No button here changes
   your TikTok budget in this version.

## Adding a campaign
New GMV Max campaign IDs go in `gmvmax-auto/.local_secrets.json` under
`TIKTOK_GMV_CAMPAIGNS` → `PRODUCT` or `LIVE` group (`"id": "label"`), then
rerun `live_view.py`. (TikTok has no list for GMV campaigns, so IDs come
from Ads Manager or the bulk export.)

## What it does NOT do (yet)
- No automatic budget changes. No Approve/Reject queue live. No Telegram actions.
- No monthly cap enforcement, no email alerts, no 50-day charts (placeholder only).
- Session list for LIVE shows nothing until max-delivery sessions are created
  in TikTok (campaign numbers are unaffected).

## Coming next (P1/P2, plain words)
- **P1:** computer drafts suggestions but only logs them + sends you a Telegram message.
- **P2:** small changes happen automatically, big ones wait for your Approve / Edit / Reject.
- Monthly spend cap + night quiet-hours handling + email backup alerts.
